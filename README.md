This project implemented and evaluated convolutional neural network (CNN) models for classifying images of cats and dogs. The dataset was organised into training, validation, and test directories, and images were preprocessed using the VGG16 preprocessing function. An initial custom CNN with two convolutional layers was built and trained, achieving high training accuracy but relatively poor validation and test performance, as shown by the confusion matrix.

Model evaluation revealed limited generalisation, with near-random classification on test data. To improve performance, a fine-tuned VGG16 transfer learning model was developed by freezing pre-trained layers and adding a new softmax classifier. The fine-tuned model achieved high training accuracy; however, validation and test results remained weak, with confusion matrices indicating balanced but inaccurate predictions. Overall, the study demonstrated the full workflow of image preprocessing, CNN training, evaluation, and transfer learning, while highlighting challenges related to overfitting and generalisation in image classification tasks.
